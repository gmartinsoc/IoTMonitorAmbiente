This project covers the code to get data from sensors. The data is published in a mongo database. Some processing is made
to show the processed data in a web page. 
First the used sensor is an arduino ESP8266. The code available use the sensor to get temperature and humidity from an 
environment using a DHT22 (or DHT11) sensor. The server side is a python web project that stay listing 
sensored data (in json formart) to save in the mongoDB. Besides, the sensing reads are used to plot graphs in a web page 
developed using python and javascript libraries.
